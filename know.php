    <p style="font-size:1.2rem;">
    A courier service is a company that offers special deliveries of packages, money, documents or information. These services usually boast faster delivery times than any alternative method of transporting documents, and many businesses rely on them. The idea of couriers has been around almost as long as civilization, with rulers in antiquity using them as a means to make new laws and edicts known throughout their lands. In the modern age of international business, this type of service has become a keystone of enterprise, even as emerging technologies such as the fax machine and Internet have rendered them less useful in some areas.The largest courier service in the world is the United Parcel Service (UPS), which delivers more than 12 million packages globally each day. UPS has its roots in the beginning of the 20th century, when it was known as the American Messenger Company. It survived the depression and the world wars, and went on to thrive in the global age. Throughout the years, it acquired other delivery services, including the Motorcycle Messengers and a number of smaller European companies.
