    <p style="font-size:1.2rem;">
    No Dangerous Goods:
No service shall be rendered in the transportation of any dangerous goods/hazardous materials which are subject to regulation by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), or the Canada Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. Goods that fall within the parameters of "Limited Quantities" under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations may be shipped with A & B Courier at the discretion of A & B Courier but only within Canada.
<br>Prohibited by Law:
No service shall be rendered by A & B Courier in the transportation of any shipment which is prohibited by law or regulations of any federal, state, provincial, or local government in the origin country or destination country.
<br>
Proper Packaging & Labeling:
Packaging: (Consider that A & B Courier and its affiliates may operate using a high-speed, high-volume, highly automated distribution system; Shippers must package their shipments in a manner that properly protects the contents during transportation.) Packages tendered to A & B Courier must be packed or wrapped as to meet the requirements set forth in International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) Procedure 3A (Procedure for Testing Packaged Products). A & B Courier will not be liable for delay, damage to or loss of goods caused or contributed to by defects or inadequacy of the packaging used by the Shipper, or for damage to or loss of the packaging used by the Shipper. The use of A & B Courier - provided packaging is not a guarantee that an item is sufficiently packaged for transportation. A & B Courier does not provide special handling for Packages bearing "Fragile," Package orientation markings (e.g., "UP" arrows or "This End Up"), or any other similar markings.

Labeling: Every package tendered to A & B Courier must contain complete From and To details including postal code or Zip code, contact names, telephone numbers and an A & B Courier tracking number. A & B Courier cannot deliver to a P.O. Box and or a Rural Route number. Shipments require a street address including apartment/suite/unit numbers and the consignee’s telephone number. Multiple-piece shipments (as defined in section 7.1) must be labeled with the full delivery address on each piece and each piece individually marked "1 of 3", "2 of 3", "3 of 3", etc.
<br>
Multiple-Piece Shipments:
All shipments covered under a single A & B Courier waybill/tracking number are considered a single shipment for the purpose of calculating shipping charges.
<br>
Rounding Measurements:
Shipment dimensions must be rounded up to the closest whole inch. Shipment weights must be rounded up to the next whole pound.
<br>
Chargeable Weight:
Transportation charges are based on the greater of the dimensional volumetric weight of the shipment or the gross weight of the shipment. Dimensional weight is based on the current International Air Transport Association (IATA) volumetric standard, which is subject to change without notice. Dimensional weight is calculated by multiplying length x width x height of each package in inches and divided by 166 for dimensional weight in pounds. When a shipment exceeds 84 inches in length and girth combined, but weighs less than 30 pounds, it will be considered an "Extra Large Package" and rated as though it weighed 30 pounds.
<br>
After Hours Charge:
An additional premium is applicable for each package/order with a required pickup or delivery time outside A & B Courier’s Regular Operating Hours. A & B Courier’s Regular Operating Hours are; but not restricted to: Weekdays from 8:00am to 5:30pm excluding Statutory Holidays. These hours are subject to change without notice. The Shipper must inform an A & B Courier customer service representative during regular operating hours of their intent to have a shipment picked up or delivered after hours. The Shipper will then be advised the service availability depending destination and will quote the price at that time. The shipper is also responsible for providing A & B Courier with contact information of a person also available during the times requested of the order in the event of an unexpected issue.
<br>
Freight-Collect or Third Party Billing Charge:
This charge only applies to domestic shipments. An additional charge may be assessed when a Shipper requires A & B Courier to invoice a third party or the consignee. Either/or must have an A & B Courier account. The Shipper must inform a customer service representative at the time of placing the order, of their request either freight-collect or third party billing. The Shipper must also mark the waybill appropriately. The Shipper agrees to pay for the service and any charges associated in the event the consignee or third party fails to pay the invoice. A & B Courier reserves the right to place the customers on a cash only basis as well as any other legal rights and remedies available to it.
<br>
Waiting Time Charge:
A "Waiting Time Charge" may be applied when an A & B Courier driver has to wait for either a pick up or delivery of a shipment. Refer to your price schedule for rates.
<br>
Vehicle Charge:
A "Waiting Time Charge" may be applied when an A & B Courier driver has to wait for either a pick up or delivery of a shipment. Refer to your price schedule for rates.
<br>

Additional Handling will not be charged in combination with a Large Package Surcharge.
<br>
